## How to get it

The Plan is to release this to the Firefox Addon Store, but atm. you need to download it from this repository and add it 
manually to your browser.

## Why?
Good Question. Let me explain.  
I tend to forget to like videos I actual enjoyed, specially when im watching a playlist and multiple videos in a row.   
This Plugin attempts to solve this problem. 

## Platforms
At the moment, this plugin targets Firefox. 
Giving the fact that the plugin is very simple and not interacting with the browser much, i would guess it works in 
Chromeium as well.  
Chromium Browsers MAY get supported in the future

## Features
Currently, this plugin likes every video you watch.

Planned for the future is, that you can specify what videos you want to auto-like. Possible woult be a Regex, that needs 
to match the channel name, video name.
